## What is Maintenance Mode for Digital Dwellers?

==*Consolidate*==

This self-guided pedagogical digital workshop encourages participants to engage their digital maintenance and archival practices through a critical lens by exploring personal data as a practice of digital memory and {{learning about digital agency}}. It offers an overview of the techniques and systems that can be utilized to help secondary and early post-secondary students maintain their digital life and materials. The approach outlined in this project is built with principles rooted in Intersectional and Critical Digital Pedagogy and methodologies of the Digital Humanities.  
  
The project was conceived around the critique of the precarious nature of digital spaces and digital ownership. We live in a society and within systems that are exploitative and extractive and it can seem insurmountable to take back our digital rights, but there are small, guided steps we can all take to reclaim power over our digital self.  
  
While this workshop is intended to be done one step after the other, move around as you like to best suit participants’ needs. If there are parts you want to take and remix for your own needs, do so with proper attribution.

Maintenance Mode for Digital Dwellers is a capstone project for the Digital Humanities Masters program at the CUNY Graduate Center. The capstone can be used as a self-guided pedagogical workshop that engages users in strategies and systems for managing their personal digital materials. Through the workshop participants are encouraged to engage their digital maintenance and archival practices through a critical lens while exploring personal data as a practice of digital memory, learning about digital agency, and interrogating what it means to maintain one’s “digital self”. 

This digital workshop offers an reflective tool and overview of some techniques and systems that can be utilized to help secondary and early post-secondary students maintain their digital life and materials.

## Why this project?
Across all sectors of human experience, from learning to leisure, digital technologies have become increasingly proprietary and often utilize surveillance tactics that leave users with little control and agency. With a growing ecosystem of digital tools and management systems that operate under those conditions it becomes vital that users learn methods to exercise control and ownership of their data and digital materials. When users are empowered, they can more easily protect themselves from malicious uses of their digital output, demand greater consumer friendly regulations from governing bodies and advocate and rally around digital tools and services that align with human and environmentally ethical values.  

The project was conceived around the critique of the precarious nature of digital spaces and digital ownership. We live in a society and within systems that are exploitative and extractive and it can seem insurmountable to take back our digital rights, but there are small, guided steps we can all take to reclaim power over our digital self.

# Project Description
Maintenance Mode for Digital Dwellers is a capstone project for the Digital Humanities Masters program at the CUNY Graduate Center. The capstone can be used as a self-guided pedagogical workshop that engages users in strategies and systems for managing their personal digital materials. Through the workshop participants are encouraged to engage their digital maintenance and archival practices through a critical lens while exploring personal data as a practice of digital memory, learning about digital agency, and interrogating what it means to maintain one’s “digital self”. 

Time permitting, this project will cover the following themes: 

Introductory terminology and basic digital infrastructure (archive, cloud vs local, metadata, backup, etc.) overview to foreground

1) Reflection: where participants critically reflect on their digital management habits and systems 
2) Digital ecosystems: where participants interrogate meaning and value of of a digital item and learn about our digital landscape as it pertains to the consequences of poor digital hygiene (micro and macro level) and technology first ethos
3) Personal preservation and archiving methods (Building your own system): where participants are introduced to methods for personal digital archive and ways they can apply it. 
4) Sustainable habits: where participants create goals for integrating maintenance mode into their digital practice  
## Project Objectives
1. Offer a introduction into personal digital archiving
2. Promote iterative practice for digital management and maintenance  
3. Create space for self reflection and system level reflection on the  "digital self" and digital ecosystems 
## Success Criteria
Maintenance Mode for Digital Dwellers can be considered a successful project if it can achieve the project objects and 
- An educator can implement some components into their class discussions and exercises
- After engaging with this lab/workshop, a student has a more strategic plan for how to organize their digital output
