## Creating a value system

Build values by thinking through these questions. (more memory route....need to make sure works for more data manage route if routes persist)
principles built like a library - "principles of deliberate acquisition, thoughtful organization, and selective retention" [^1]

These are some questions to start thinking about your value system:

(*figure out wp citation system)
- What story or feeling do you want to preserve? What emotional tone does this capsule carry: celebration, remembrance, grief, joy?  
- Who is your audience: your future self, family, a future researcher, a larger community?  
- What context needs to be retained for future understanding?  
- What kind of media captures this best: text, photo, audio, video, artifacts? Why did you choose what you did?  
- What items would you miss the most if digital platforms went down or the items became unavailable? (Make a list).  
- Should these items be available immediately, or unlocked after a certain amount of time?  
- Once opened, should the capsule remain accessible, or eventually disappear?



While there are many ways to practice personal digital archive some of the core focuses that are useful for a student are 
- File organizing and naming conventions
- Versioning 
- Organization and maneuvering for collaborative work


- File Naming & Folder Structure  
	- Principles of naming files clearly (date-topic-version)  
	- Creating intuitive folder hierarchies by subject/project  
	- students organize a mock messy drive)  
- Storage & Backup Systems  
	- Understanding local vs. cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)  
	- Introduction to external storage and version control (USB, hard drives, Git basics)  
	- Compare and contrast pros/cons of different backup methods  
- Cross-Platform Strategies  
	- Syncing materials across devices (e.g., Notes apps, Google Drive + Notion workflows)  
	- Accessibility for mobile vs. desktop  
- Archiving & Letting Go  
	- How to decide what to keep, archive, or delete  
	- review and archive/delete old digital files  
- Metadata & Searchability  
	- Basics of metadata and why searchable titles matter  
	- Tools for tagging or color coding
